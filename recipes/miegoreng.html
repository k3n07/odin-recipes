<!-- Description of the recipe-->
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>What I love most about Mie Goreng is that it’s so versatile. As long as you have cabbage, kecap manis and noodles, you can add just about any protein and or vegetable. It’s all about the ingredients you have available. I always make it when I have leftovers from other dishes or when some of the vegetables in my fridge are on the verge of going bad.</p>
