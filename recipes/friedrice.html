    <!-- Description of the recipe -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Stir fried rice is really a great springboard for adaptation. This one is simply flavored and has more than four cups of chopped and sliced vegetables, such as carrots, peppers, and broccoliâ€”though you can change up the vegetables as you like!</p>

        <li>3 cups  cooked and cooled white or brown rice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon peeled and minced fresh ginger</li>

    <!-- Steps to make the dish -->

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook the veggies:Heat a wok or a large skillet over high heat until very hot. Add 1 tablespoon of oil, and then the broccoli, carrots, cabbage, zucchini, peppers, and edamame.</li>
        <li>Scramble the eggs: Season the beaten eggs with a little salt and pepper. Heat 1 more tablespoon of oil in the same wok or skillet over high heat. Add the beaten eggs and scramble quickly, just about 1 minute. When they are just cooked through, slide them out onto the plate with the vegetables.</li>
        <li>Stir fry the rice: Return the wok to the burner over high heat, add the remaining tablespoon of oil, then add the cooled rice. Stir fry, stirring occasionally, until it is lightly browned in spots, about 5 minutes. Add the ginger and the garlic to the rice, and stir until they're fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the soy sauce, sesame oil, and 1/2 cup scallions.</li>
        <li>Finish the stir fry: Return the vegetables and eggs to the wok with the rice. Cook, stirring often, until everything is combined and hot and the vegetables are just tender, about 3 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper, if needed.</li>
        <li>Garnish and serve: Sprinkle the additional scallions over the top, and serve right away, passing soy sauce on the side for those who want a bit more.</li>

    </ol>
