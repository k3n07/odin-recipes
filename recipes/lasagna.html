    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Vegetarian lasagna was the first big dinner I learned how to make. When I was in college, a vegetable lasagna would always be the main event when I cooked a meal for a group. Fast forward to now, and I still like to make one when I’m serving a crowd, especially around the holidays. A veggie lasagna is comforting, flavorful, and great for making ahead. Plus, who doesn’t love to swap stories at the table over red sauce and pasta?!</p>
    <p>I’m sharing my favorite vegetarian lasagna recipe below. It’s savory and satisfying, filled with roasted veggies, creamy ricotta cheese, ruffly noodles, and plenty of marinara sauce. I think you’re going to love it!</p>

    <!-- Ingredients list -->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fresh veggies,</strong> of course! I pack this vegetable lasagna with roasted red bell peppers, zucchini, onions, mushrooms, and baby spinach. They add SO much flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Lasagna noodles</strong> – No-boil noodles seem convenient—but trust me, the regular kind are better. They take less than 10 minutes to cook, and they have a perfect tender texture in the final lasagna.</li>
        <li><strong>Marinara sauce</strong> – Make homemade marinara sauce, or use a 24-ounce jar of store-bought sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Ricotta cheese</strong> – It creates a creamy, cheesy layer between the noodles, sauce, and veggies. I season it with garlic and lemon zest for bright, savory flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Shredded pecorino and mozzarella cheese</strong> – For topping the lasagna. Not a pecorino person? Parmesan cheese works too!</li>
        <li><strong>And fresh basil and/or parsley</strong> – For garnish.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Steps to make the dish -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Before you assemble the lasagna, complete these 3 prep steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Roast the veggies.</strong> Toss the peppers, zucchini, onions, and mushrooms with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Bake at 425°F until they’re tender and caramelized.</li>
        <li><strong>Boil the noodles</strong> until al dente. Toss them with a drizzle of olive oil to prevent sticking!</li>
        <li><strong>Make the ricotta filling.</strong> Mix the ricotta cheese with the lemon zest, garlic, salt, and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
        <p>Now you're ready to layer!</p>

    <p>How to layer the Vegetable Lasagna</p>
    <p>Start with a 9×13-inch baking dish. Spread 1 cup of the tomato sauce on the bottom.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Then, add a layer of noodles.</li>
        <li>Top the noodles with half the ricotta mixture.</li>
        <li>Layer half the spinach over the ricotta, and scatter half the roasted vegetables in an even layer.</li>
        <li>Dot the vegetables with 2/3 cup of the marinara sauce.</li>    
    </ol>
    <p>Repeat the layering process in the same order.</p>
    <p>Top with a final layer of noodles, the remaining sauce, and the shredded cheese.</p>
